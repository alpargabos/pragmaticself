How to Stop Depression
A little trick for a better life
When you are in a bad mood and negativity flows around you, try to imagine yourself as a bucket full of dark water that needs to be cleaned.
There are two ways to clean the dark water.
The first solution is to pour the water out of the bucket and refill it with clean water. Very few people are capable of doing this. You can achieve this with crying. You cry for an hour and after that you feel relieved/happy. Or in a more mannish way: you just flip the switch(sad/happy) in your brain and everything feels super. To be able to do that you have to know how to control your brain (more from this in the next episode: Perception).
The second solution is easier. Continuously pour clean water in the bucket. The clean water dilutes the dark and the extra water flows out. With time the bucket will only contain crystal clear water. This works with your mind too. Continuously consume motivational, inspirational and up-lifting contents and you become happier and happier. The internet is full of motivational videos, articles. There are a lot of good uplifting movies. And of course you can listen music which makes you happy.
But be aware of the fact that this method works in the other way too. If you listen to pessimistic people all the time, watch news on TV which only shows the dark side of the world, or stay in your room alone with your self deprecating thoughts, then you will soon realize your water became dark again. And unfortunately for us, humans, it is much easier to be depressed than to be joyful.
This life is your life! Your happiness is your responsibility. So take care of your good mood! From time to time watch inspirational movies, read motivational articles and listen to uplifting music.
Note: Some people believe there is an easier way of creating happy moments in your life. With the usage of drugs. I am totally against it! Because after the effects fly away you find yourself in a much deeper pit than before. And you will use it again to be able to feel some happiness and you will go in a deeper pit after that. And this will continue until you cannot make it to the surface no matter what you do. So never ever use chemicals to reach happiness. And by the way watching motivational videos on youtube is cheaper than drugs!
